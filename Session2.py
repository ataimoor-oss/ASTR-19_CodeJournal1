#Session 2 
#Write a Python that prints the sum of two floating point numbers, the difference between two integers, and the product of a floating point number and an integer. In each case, have the program print out the data type of the resulting answer.

#Floating point sum
a = 16.3
b = 1.4
sum_result = a + b
print("Sum:", sum_result, "Type:", type(sum_result))

#Integer Difference 
x = 21
y = 20
diff_result = x - y
print("Difference:", diff_result, "Type:", type(diff_result))

#Float * Int product
f = 6.7
n = 420
product_result = f * n
print("Product:", product_result, "Type:", type(product_result))
